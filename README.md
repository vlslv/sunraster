# sunraster

Sunraster is a [SunPy](http://sunpy.org)-affiliated package that provides the tools to read in and
analyze data from the [IRIS](http://iris.lmsal.com) solar-observing satellite in Python.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph is a NASA-funded Small Explorer which uses a
high-frame-rate ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to make observations of the Sun. It provides
0.3 arcsec angular resolution and sub-angstrom spectral resolution at a one second cadence.

For more information see the mission/instrument paper which is available [online for free](https://www.lmsal.com/iris_science/doc?cmd=dcur&proj_num=IS0196&file_type=pdf).
